# x16r_hash
The X16R hashing algorithm consists of 16 hashing algorithms operating in chain fashion with the ordering dependent on the last 8 bytes (16 nibbles) of the hash of the previous block. The algorithms are as follows:
Order	Algo
0	blake
1	bmw
2	groestl
3	jh
4	keccak
5	skein
6	luffa
7	cubehash
8	shavite
9	simd
10	echo
11	hamsi
12	fugue
13	shabal
14	whirlpool
15	sha512
